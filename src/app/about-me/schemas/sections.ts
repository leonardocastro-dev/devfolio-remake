  intro: `/**
 * I’m a full stack developer who genuinely enjoys both sides of the stack —
 * from building clean, intuitive interfaces to crafting reliable, well-structured
 * APIs with Node.js.
 *
 * I’m all about turning ideas into real products that work, perform well,
 * and make sense to the people using them. Node.js is my comfort zone on the backend,
 * but I’m equally invested in frontend development when it comes to delivering
 * great user experiences.
 *
 * I enjoy solving real-world problems, keeping things simple when possible,
 * and learning every day — especially about system architecture, cloud infrastructure,
 * and finding better ways to ship high-quality software, faster.
 *
 * If you’re into building solid products and enjoy good tech conversations,
 * feel free to reach out.

  personality: `/**
 * I'm driven by challenges. I have a natural energy that pushes me
 * to be the best in everything I do.
 * I like to stand out not only for what I deliver,
 * but for how I think, shape the environment, and solve problems.
 *
 * I carry a competitiveness that doesn't depend on external rivalry.
 * My competition is with myself. I'm always trying to surpass my own benchmarks,
 * raise my standards, and through this, inspire those around me.
 *
 * There's a constant thirst for evolution within me — and a genuine passion
 * for being recognized for what I do well. This feeling of seeing my potential
 * acknowledged drives me, challenges me, and makes me want to go even further.
 *
 * Collaboration is part of my way of working. I believe in the power of
 * exchanging ideas, active listening, and building together.
 * Great results are born when talents truly combine.
 *
 * I'm curious, proactive, and determined. When I dive into a project,
 * I give it my all. I'm always learning, evolving, and seeking
 * to surprise — others, and especially, myself.
 *
 * I'm ready to take on significant responsibilities. I have attention to detail
 * and a genuine desire to make an impact wherever I am.
