 * into smart, well-crafted solutions.
 *
 * I love working across the full stack, always with a user-first mindset

 *
 * For me, tech is more than just code — it's about solving problems,
 * optimizing experiences, and creating things that truly make a difference.
 *
 * I'm always exploring new tools and challenges, and yeah,
 * coffee definitely helps keep the ideas flowing!
